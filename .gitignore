/bin/
/obj/

# Using `obj/*` and `bin/*` in a `.gitignore` file ignores all files and
# subfolders inside `obj` and `bin`. While the folders themselves are not
# directly ignored, they effectively behave like the other patterns since
# Git doesn’t track empty folders once their contents are ignored or removed.
# In contrast, `obj/` or `/obj/` (similarly `bin/` or `/bin/`) ignores the
# entire folder and all its contents from the repository root, ensuring
# neither the folders nor their contents are tracked. The leading `/`
# simply anchors the path to the repo root, but the effect is the same when
# placed at the root.

# Note: `.gitignore` only prevents untracked files from being added; it does
# not automatically remove files or folders that are already tracked by Git.
# If `obj/` and `bin/` were previously committed, Git will continue to track
# them even after adding them to `.gitignore`. To stop tracking them while keeping
# them locally, run:

# git rm -r --cached obj bin
# git commit -m "Stop tracking obj and bin folders"
